# GitHub Todo Webtask

This webtask was created with [webtask.io](http://webtask.io) as a webhook triggered by GitHub `push` events. It has been implemented on this repository. The payload URL is generated by Auth0 webtask and provides parameters for a token and MongoDB database.

When triggered, the webhook checks the payload for commits with messages containing a keyword: `todo`. If the `todo` keyword (case insensitive) is found, an  object is inserted into a MongoDB database on [mlab](https://mlab.com) called `git-push-todo` (to the `todos` collection) with the following properties:
 
 * `todo`: First occurrence of the keyword and subsequent text
 * `timestamp`: commit timestamp
 * `author`: committer's name
 
If a commit's message does not contain a `todo` keyword, nothing is inserted into the database for that commit.

##Potential Enhancements
* Save multiple `todo` database documents from a single commit message if the "todo" keyword appears more than once within the message
* Create an application that displays the collection in the browser
* Build a full To Do application with the collection that can update the database to change the status of or delete the todos
* ...etc
